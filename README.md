# The Concordia Sacrae Static Website

At this point the Concordia Sacrae website is a trivial single HTML5 + trivial JS page and is out of date.  The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the new Concordia Sacrae
Static Website will be built using Jekyll, with the Material Design / Bootstrap framework from MDB5.  The intent is deploy this to the Content Delivery Network (CDN)
of CloudFlare.
